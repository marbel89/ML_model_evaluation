# MLModel Hyperparameter Tuning
### Overview

This project provides a generalizable Python class, MLModel, that performs hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV for various machine learning models. The project demonstrates how to tune and evaluate models such as RandomForestClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier using a dataset of customer churn.

### Features

    Generalized ML Model Tuning: Easily adaptable to different machine learning models.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizes RandomizedSearchCV for efficient hyperparameter search.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as ROC AUC and accuracy.

### Requirements

    Python 3.x
    scikit-learn
    pandas

### Usage

Optional: Set up the hyperparameter search grid for your models.
Other than that, run ML_Model with the respective dataset.
